# Introduction Datacamp Project
This is an introduction to DataCamp projects. DataCamp projects allow you to apply the skills you've learned in DataCamp courses. In each project, you will carry out an end-to-end analysis, on real-world tasks, using real-world tools and workflows.  In this gentle introduction to DataCamp projects, we will walk you through the projects interface and you will learn how to work with Jupyter notebooks: an open-source web application that is great for interactive data analysis
